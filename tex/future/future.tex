		\subsection{Security}
			User input hasn't been fully tested/sanitised for malicious intent.

		\subsection{Large-scale performance}
			Game lobbies should be distributed amongst a cluster, to reduce load when many lobbies are running concurrently.

	\section{Improve AI}
		The AI is fairly primitive and there exist several enhancements and optimisations which could be implemented. This section shall lightly touch upon some of these.

	\section{Gameplay Features}
		I've tried to design the current implementation in a flexible manner to reduce the complexity in adding additional features. In particular, this includes things such as player speed, size, colors etc...

		Also the front-end, being built with React, is decoupled into components which can be extended upon without too much hassle. This is a good thing because the DOM can now be 'synced' with the game state.
