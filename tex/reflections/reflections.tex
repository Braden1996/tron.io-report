	\section{Reflections}
		\subsection{Multifaceted}
			The project incorporates many aspects. Some of which require so much work that they individually could constitute as the entire basis of this project.

		\subsection{Game Design}
			Several seemingly minor game design choices had quite severe effects. In particular, the decision for players to move freely as opposed to being restrained to a cell within a grid.

		\subsection{Technologies Used}
			Talk about the technologies used and how they affected development. For example, some do not specifically cater toward game development; creating unnecessary restrictions/difficulty. Talk about how I overcame these. Also results in spending a lot of time on issues that aren't explicitly related to the problem at hand.
