	Throughout this report we shall develop a multiplayer implementation of the game Tron, that features a computer opponent player controlled by an artificial intelligence.

	It is somewhat well known that in the early 2000s the web began to transition from static pages to web-applications, i.e. those powered by user-generated content and dynamic HTML. This new form of the web was coined Web 2.0 \parencite{Web20}. However in recent years, with the release of technologies such as HTML5, web-browsers have evolved considerably; increasing the potential of their role in a web-application. It is because of this that we are to develop the game to be played by able-bodied computer user within a modern web-browser platform, that does not require any third-party addons - such as Adobe Flash.

	The scope of this project isn't to develop a fully-polished consumer ready product, but instead to create a functioning prototype that could feasibly be extended upon. As such, the main beneficiaries of this project are those who are investigating the feasibility of implementing a video-game, or similar, in a web-browser; specifically aspects include graphics, network communication and artificial intelligence.

	In an abstract sense, the game we are to develop will support multiple simultaneous game lobbies, where within each lobby two or more players are able to play against one-another over a network. The host player, of a particular lobby, will be able to customise various aspects of their game lobby; including configurations, managing connected players, and adding computer opponents. Where the AI is not intended to be perfect, but to provide enough of a challenge that the game still remains enjoyable.
